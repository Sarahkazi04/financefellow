                <p>1. Amortization: This is a technique for distributing the cost of an intangible asset over the period of its useful life. Non-physical assets that are vital to a business are known as intangible assets. Examples of these include franchise agreements, patents, trademarks, and copyrights.</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Assets: These are the things you hold that your firm may be able to use in the future, such cash, merchandise, real estate, office supplies, or accounts receivable, which are money owed by clients to a corporation. Various kinds of assets exist, such as:</p><br>
                <p>Current Assets: Those that within a year can be turned into cash
                    Fixed assets are tangible goods that a business owns and uses to produce long-term income but which cannot be quickly converted into cash.
                    </p><br>
                <p>3. Asset Allocation: The process of dividing your funds among several investment kinds, or asset classes, is referred to as asset allocation. These consist of:
                    Bonds: A type of borrowing is represented by bonds. In essence, you are lending money to the government or a company when you purchase a bond. Periodically, you receive interest payments, and when the bond matures—that is, when it can be redeemed—you get your money back.
                    Shares of ownership in a public or private corporation are represented by stocks. Purchasing stock in a firm entitles you access dividends, or the profits of the business, if and when they are paid out.
                    </p><br>
                <p>Cash and Cash Equivalents: This includes any asset that is in the form of cash or that is readily convertible into cash should the need arise. Table of Balances: An essential financial document that conveys an organization's value, or "book value," is the balance sheet. The organization's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity are totaled for a certain reporting period and presented on the balance sheet.
                    The equation for a balance sheet: The balance sheet arrangement is determined by the following equation: Liabilities plus Owners' Equity equals assets.
                    </p><br>
                <p>5. Gain in Capital: An item or investment that has increased in value above what you originally paid for it is referred to as a capital gain. It would be seen as a capital gain if you sold the asset for less than the original acquisition price.</p>
                <p>6. Capital Market: This is the market where traders of financial assets, such as bonds and stocks, transact. There are various players in the capital markets, such as:</p>
                <p>Companies: Businesses that offer investors stocks and bonds</p><br>
                <p>Investors with institutions: investors acting on behalf of a sizable capital base by buying stocks and bonds</p><br>
                <p>Mutual funds: An institutional investor that oversees thousands of individual investors is a mutual fund.</p><br>
                <p>hedge funds: Another kind of institutional investor is a hedge fund, which manages risk by hedging, which is the practice of purchasing one stock and then shorting another to profit from the difference in the two stocks' respective performances.</p><br>
                <p>7. Cash Flow: The net amount of money coming into and going out of a company at a given moment is referred to as cash flow. Three categories are commonly used to categorize cash flow:</p><br>
                <p>Operating Cash Flow: The net cash produced by regular company activities
                    Investments Cash flow refers to the amount of money that is left over after investing in securities and buying or selling assets.
                    </p><br>
                <p>Financing Cash Flow: The net cash produced for paying off debt, stockholders' equity, and dividends while operating a business.</p><br>
                <p>8. Statement of Cash Flow: A financial statement created to give a thorough analysis of what happened to a company's cash over a specific time period is called a cash flow statement. This document details the revenue and expenses that the company.</p><br>
                <p>9. Compound Interest: The term "interest on interest" describes this. Instead, compound interest is earned on the amount you deposited plus any interest you've accrued over time when you invest or save. Compound interest is applied to both the original amount lent to you and the expenses that are added to your outstanding balance over time, so while it can increase your savings, it can also increase your debt.</p><br>
                <p>10. Depreciation: The term "depreciation" refers to the reduction in value of an asset. It's a term from accounting that describes how much of an asset's value a company has used over time.
                </p><br>
                <p>11. Equity: The amount of money that remains to the owners of a company after all assets and liabilities have been taken into account is known as equity, sometimes referred to as owners' equity or shareholders' equity on a balance sheet. Shareholder's equity can be calculated using the accounting equation by deducting total liabilities from total assets.</p><br>
                <p>12. Income Statement: An income statement is a financial document that lists the earnings and outlays for a specific time period for a company. A profit and loss (P&L) statement is another name for an income statement.</p><br>
                <p>13.Net Worth: Your net worth is determined by deducting your liabilities from your possessions. The remainder can assist you in assessing your overall financial situation.</p><br>
                <p>14. Profit Margin: The net income divided by revenue or the net profit divided by sales yields the profit margin, which is a measure of profitability. Businesses frequently examine two kinds of profit margins:
                    Gross profit margin: Usually pertains to a single product or line item rather than the whole company.
                    Net Profit Margin: Usually a measure of an organization's overall profitability
                    </p><br>
                    <p>15. Liabilities: The reverse of assets, liabilities are the things you owe other people. These include unpaid salaries, bank debt, and accounts payable, or money owed to suppliers. Different categories of liabilities exist, such as:
                        Short-term liabilities, or current liabilities, are obligations that are due within the next year.
                        Extended-Term Debts: These are debts that can be paid off over a longer time period and are not due for payment for more than a year.
                        </p><br>
                <p>16. Liquidity: The speed at which your assets can be turned into cash is referred to as liquidity. Cash is the most liquid asset as a result. Since they can take weeks or months to sell, assets like real estate and land are the least liquid.</p><br>
                <p>17. Valuation: The process of figuring out how much an asset, business, or liability is currently worth is called valuation. Although there are many methods to value a business, it is beneficial to repeat the process on a regular basis so that you are prepared in case you come across an opportunity to sell or merge your business or need to look for outside funding.</p><br>
